      h2 Business Law
      p Our community is defined by its small business owners and professional service providers. However, many a business is bogged down by inefficient corporate form, flawed contract negotiations and other common-place errors that a non-lawyer could not be expected to be aware of. 

      p We are committed to the ideal of honest representation and upfront costs. We can help you develop a business, grow a business, include new owners, terminate the business, or restructure it. Below are some of the areas We can assist you with, and the prices for my services. Please note that this does not include statutory fees or costs of publishing announcements.

            p I can help you purchase or sell an existing business, including negotiating the contract of sale, purchase of existing inventory, and transfer of good will. I can also help you purchase, sell or transfer a franchise (McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts). I will diligently ensure that the business you are purchasing is a legal, legitimate operation, and that there are no tax, judgment or pending litigation liens upon it. 

            p I will handle all phases of the transfer, and work together with you. My fee is $700 dollars if the business is valued under $100,000, and escalates by $150 for every $100,000 of additional value of the transaction. My goal is to help you ensure your transfer is successful without draining your finances or rendering legal services beyond your budget.

            p Any business with more than one owner or shareholder should have an agreement that states who owns what percentage of the assets, profits and liabilities. Such an agreement must also reflect all contingencies, including death, incapacity or serious disputes between partners and shareholders, as well as a method for valuing shares and allowing new members to enter the organization. I will charge you $500 for an agreement for an existing business, and $300 for one I am also helping you create.
