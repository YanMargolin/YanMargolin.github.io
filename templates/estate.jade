      h2 Estate Planning
      p One's estate represents as lifetime of work, investment and savings. Every person's goal should be twofold: to make sure your assets are distributed amongst your children, family, friends or favorite causes as you intend, and to protect your assets from unnecessary taxation or creditors. My services are reasonably priced, but unlike the “Draft Your Own Will” kits on sale, We will counsel you directly, and make sure the results are exactly as you intend. 
      p We will meet with you in person and discuss your assets, your liabilities and your long-term wishes. We will advise you as to your options both during and after life. The rate for this depends entirely on the nature of work necessary for your plan.

        h2 Wills 
        p A simple will is one that has no tax planning included. Instead, the will shall reflect your assets and how you wish to pass those assets on to your loved ones. A will is also meant to reflect your soundness of mind at the time you are drafting the document. If your mindset is later called into question, this document, as well as a Self-Affirming Affidavit we prepare along with your will shall protect your wishes from challengers.

        h2 Trusts
        p A trust can feature 3 individuals: a Grantor (you) who provides the property placed into trust, a Trustee who manages the property, and a Beneficiary who is able to benefit from the property according to the Trustees decisions as guided by the Grantor's intent and instructions. Therefore, ownership is split between control by the Trustee, and benefit by the Beneficiary.

      h2 Powers of Attorney, Healthcare Proxy and Living Will
      p Sadly, many people do not realize that there may come a time when you or someone you love will become mentally or physically incapacitated while still in the latter stages of life. We will assist in preparing any of the above that your situation requires.

      p A Power of Attorney allows you to designate another person you trust (who does not need to be an attorney) to make your financial decisions for you. New York State has recently instituted changes that allow you to careful dictate how much your agent is allowed to gift to others or himself. The cost for a power of attorney is $200 per person.

      p A Healthcare Proxy designates a person who will make medical decisions for you. A living will, usually prepared with the Healthcare Proxy, sets certain decisions made by you in advance, including whether you wish to be kept on artificial life support. Together, the documents are $200, or $300 for a couple.

      p For a low hourly rate, we will assist you in probating (judicially confirming) a will and distributing assets under it.

We can also advise a trustee as to how best to use his or her power under either a Trust or a Power of Attorney.
